### Overview

> Context gives readers information about a particular book, its author, country history, and the historical context of the novel or its plot.

> By querying data from the Wikipedia API, the books created in Context users will store the necessary information from Wikipedia into the app's database. 

> Users will then be able to save books to their own shelf, add comments, or even delete the books entirely.
