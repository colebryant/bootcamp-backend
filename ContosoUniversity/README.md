## Tutorial

Please do the [ASP.NET Core MVC with Entity Framework Core - Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/?view=aspnetcore-2.2) in which you will build a small web application using EF. It shows you how to configure your application for using it, how to set up a database context, and how to use that database context with LINQ statements to interact with a database.
